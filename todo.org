** TODO Concatenate four frame in to one image and use transfert learning
** TODO Merge the best model using the image with the best using only meta data.
** DONE Metadata model only loss on the blank category

** DONE Train a model using RESNET50 instead as a feature extractor
** DONE Train a model using only meta data - Start with a neural network.
** DONE It should be able to return stuff.

** DONE Train a model elegant benchmark on the 224/224 images

   Benchnmark using the same model as the driven data team

** DONE Write an inspector which can easily compute metrics on the validation set.

** DONE ADD PARAMETERS TO SELECT AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF FRAME

* Ideas

- Concatenate four image 64 side on to a 224/224 images and pass that into the network
- Distributed RESNET50 on 4 images .
